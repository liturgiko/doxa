# DOXA

DOXA is a desktop application that provides tools for users to create or enter translations of Eastern Orthodox Christian Akolouthia (services) and publish Digital Orthodox Akolouthia as a website for use in liturgical services. It is available for download [here](https://github.com/liturgiko/doxa/releases). 

## Sample Websites Created Using DOXA

[Liturgia Digital](https://liturgia.mx) is a Spanish liturgical website in use by the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Mexico, with use in Mexico, Central America, the Carribean, and parts of South America. The Digital Orthodox Akolouthia (services) are generated using DOXA.  In addition to Spanish, it provides akolouthia (services) in English and Greek.

A second DOXA generated website with Digital Orthodox Akolouthia is under development for [East Africa](https://eac.liml.org) and will provide services in Swahili, English, French, and Greek. 

Both of the above websites are produced by members of [OCMC](https://ocmc.org) who are conducting pre-beta testing of DOXA.  OCMC has plans to use DOXA to produce Digital Orthodox Akolouthia (services) in other languages around the world.

In the USA, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America plans to use DOXA to replace the current software they use to produce the [GOA Digital Chant Stand](https://dcs.goarch.org).  

DOXA is not just for the Greek Orthodox.

DOXA is designed for to produce Digital Orthodox Akolouthia for any language, as spoken in any country, for any jurisdiction.    

For the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), the first public release of DOXA will include features to meet the needs for the formatting of hymns. 

We are looking for an Orthodox Christian who is proficient in reading and writing Arabic to work with us to perfect DOXA's ability to accurately handle the contextual forms or variants of the letters when generating PDF files.  When that is complete, DOXA will be able to bilingual services for the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. 

### Disclaimer

Software such as DOXA, and its predecessor ALWB, are powerful tools for generating daily services with the variable parts, but require a user who is skilled in the Typikon of their jurisdiction and who takes the time to enter translations and create or modify template files as needed. Fr. Seraphim Dedes, who generates the GOA DCS using ALWB, said without the software, it took him three weeks of every month to produce just Sunday matin services for the following month and publish them to a website as PDF files.  With ALWB, he is able to generate all daily services for 3-6 months at a time.  DOXA will replace ALWB and provide additional capabilities.

We will develop and provide a DOXA user guide and training materials in the coming year.

#### Please note that this software is under development.  It is in pre-beta testing with a small group of users.  We hope to have a beta-test version ready in 2025 and will invite certain individuals to participate in testing it. Until then, do not attempt to use DOXA unless you are one of our alpha version testers.

### How to Download and Install DOXA

_Currently, the window's version of DOXA has some issues._  

The DOXA executable files for Mac OS and Windows can be downloaded from the [Releases page](https://github.com/liturgiko/doxa/releases).  Follow the instructions found there.  

DOXA only needs to be installed once.  After that it automatically checks for a new release and prompts the user for permission to install it.  The source code for each release is also provided.

When DOXA starts up, it will initialize a working directory, create a database, and download template files.   

The DOXA user guide has not been developed yet.  Generating a Liturgical Website is quite complicated even though we have tried to make it as easy as possible.  Without training, or a user guide, it is very challenging to use DOXA.  So, we recommend that you wait.  

## Purpose of DOXA

DOXA is not machine translation software. It does not translate.  Its primary purpose is provide human translators of the Eastern Orthodox Christian Akolouthia, liturgical services, with functionality similar to [ParaText](https://paratext.org) for Bible translators, providing them information that they need as they create their translation.

However, the initial public release of DOXA focuses on publication of liturgical services.  It will allow translators to *Prepare* their translations and *Protect* them from accidental loss or unauthorized changes.  It will also provide the means to *Publish* translations as PDF files for commercial printing of service books and to publish an entire liturgical website with service books and daily services with variable parts.  An example website currently generated using DOXA tools is [liturgia.mx](https://liturgia.mx).  DOXA can generate PDFs and website content in up to three languages side-by-side.

After the initial public release of DOXA, future releases will add features similar to *ParaText*. The  *Prepare* functionality will be expanded to provide tools to create and view exegetical resources, known as *Liturgical Translators Handbooks*, patterned on the United Bible Societies *Translators Handbooks* series for Bible translators. In both Biblical and liturgical text translation, such handbooks are a critical quality assurance tool.  They are used by translators to understand the meaning of the source text, potential translation issues, and how these issues might be addressed.  They are used by translator project advisors working with people translating the texts into their native language. Translation advisors are individuals qualified in theology, linguistics, translation theory and practice, and project management, who live with the people and have become fluent in their language.   Translators Handbooks are also used by translation consultants, to confirm the quality of the translators, assisting the translation team to remove any identified inaccuracies.  In support of the translation quality assurance process, DOXA will add the ability to *Plan* and manage translation projects, *Participate* as a member of a translation team, and to *Prove* the accuracy and understandability of the translations.
