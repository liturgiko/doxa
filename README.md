# doxa
Doxa provides tools for researchers, translators, and publishers of Eastern Orthodox Christian liturgical texts. 

To install doxa for the first time, follow the instructions in the releases section to the [right](https://github.com/liturgiko/doxa/releases).

Once doxa has been installed, each time it runs, it reads the release.json file in this repository and updates itself with the consent of the user if a newer version exists.

The source code for doxa is also on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ocmc/liturgiko/doxa).
